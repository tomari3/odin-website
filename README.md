Afer messing around on my own with HTML and CSS this is the first website Ill make after more guidence, using the excellent path of The Odin Project.
All of my interaction with Github is using the terminal, as well as the repo creation, the web files initialization, add, commit and so on.
Another great step towards being a developer! Hurray.
